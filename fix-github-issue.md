Using the gh command, load the specified GitHub issue and produce a structured plan to resolve or implement it.

1. **Load the issue context**
   - Retrieve the issue and its comments using:
     `gh issue view $ISSUE_NUMBER --comments --json title,body,comments,author,url`
   - Parse and analyse:
       • The main issue description and intent.  
       • All comments and discussion for clarifications or context.  
       • Any related links, dependencies, or blockers.

2. **Analyse and understand**
   - Determine the core objective or bug to fix.  
   - Identify the affected components, modules, or systems.  
   - Extract any proposed solutions or developer notes.  
   - Spot missing information or ambiguities that require assumption or clarification.

3. **Generate a plan of action**
   - Draft a clear, technical, and step-by-step plan including:
       • **Summary:** One-sentence goal of the issue.  
       • **Analysis:** Understanding of the root cause or feature requirements.  
       • **Implementation Plan:** Ordered list of code changes, refactors, or new files needed.  
       • **Testing/Validation:** How to verify success.  
       • **Potential Risks / Edge Cases.**  
       • **Estimated Effort / Time.**

4. **Present and confirm**
   - Output the full plan directly into this chat.  
   - Ask:  
     “Would you like me to start working on this now?”  
   - Wait for confirmation before taking any further automated action.

Ensure the plan is specific, technically sound, and ready for execution.
